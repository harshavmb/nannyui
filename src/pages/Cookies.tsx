                    Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. 
                    Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, 
                    as well as to provide reporting information.

                    enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
